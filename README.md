Boston House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a simple machine learning project that uses a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston based on available features.

Project Highlights:
- Cleaned and analyzed a real-world dataset.
- Trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- Visualized the regression line and evaluated model accuracy using RÂ² score.

Dataset:
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains various features like number of rooms, crime rate, and distance to employment centers.

Goal:
To build a basic regression model to predict the price of a house given certain features, demonstrating a foundational machine learning technique.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
